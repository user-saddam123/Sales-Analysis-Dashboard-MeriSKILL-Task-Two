## Objective:

As part of my MeriSkill virtual internship, the "Sales Data Analysis" project aims to analyze extensive sales data to uncover valuable insights that can drive business decisions. The primary objectives include identifying sales trends over time, determining top-selling products, calculating key revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and creating compelling visualizations to effectively communicate the findings. This project demonstrates proficiency in handling and analyzing large datasets, ultimately providing data-driven recommendations to optimize sales strategies.
